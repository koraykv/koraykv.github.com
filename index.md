I am a research scientist at Google DeepMind. Previously, I was a researcher at [Deepmind Technologies](http://www.deepmind.com) and before that a research staff member at [NEC Labs America](http://www.nec-labs.com/) in the [machine learning department](http://www.nec-labs.com/research/machine/ml_website/index.php). During my PhD, I was in [Yann LeCun](http://yann.lecun.com/)'s group ([Computational and Biological Learning Lab](http://cs.nyu.edu/~yann)) at [New York University](http://www.nyu.edu) and worked on unsupervised learning of feature extractors and multi-stage architectures for object recognition. Before starting computer science studies, I did my masters and undergraduate on [aerospace engineering](http://ae.metu.edu.tr/).

# Torch7

[Ronan Collobert](http://ronan.collobert.com) from [Idiap](http://www.idiap.ch), [Clement Farabet](http://clement.farabet.net) from [NYU](http://www.nyu.edu) and myself are developing the new version of well-known machine learning library [Torch5](http://torch5.sf.net), an efficient machine learning environment. If you are interested in trying one of the [fastest machine learning library](http://cs.nyu.edu/~koray/files/2011_torch7_nipsw.pdf) check out [Torch7](http://www.torch.ch).
