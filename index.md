Currently, I am the Director of Research at [DeepMind](http://www.deepmind.com), where previously I was a research scientist and led the deep learning team. Before joining DeepMind, I was a research staff member at [NEC Labs America](http://www.nec-labs.com/) in the [machine learning department](http://www.nec-labs.com/research-departments/machine-learning/machine-learning-home). During my PhD, I was in [Yann LeCun](http://yann.lecun.com/)'s group ([Computational and Biological Learning Lab](http://cs.nyu.edu/~yann)) at [New York University](http://www.nyu.edu) and worked on unsupervised learning of feature extractors and multi-stage architectures for object recognition. Before starting computer science studies, I did my masters and undergraduate on [aerospace engineering](http://ae.metu.edu.tr/).
